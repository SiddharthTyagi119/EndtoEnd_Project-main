Ingest the data from source and after data ingestion our data will be in train and test.
validate the train and test data with the main data file.
transform both train and test data and build the model.
After deploying the first model
next model (pipeline on new dataset) . new model will be save in saved dir
we will compare the new model and the base model to choose the best model to deploy further.
whichever model will give best accuracy on our main data will deploy that.
